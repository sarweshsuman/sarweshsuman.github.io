          <p class="lead">In last couple of years, we have heard a lot about chatbots. It is being adopted rapidly across industries like banking, finance, entertainment, news, health to name a few. It is predicted that chatbots will replace more than 90% of the apps on our smartphones in coming 5 years.</p>

          <p> <p class="mb-0"> <b> What are Chatbots ? </b></p>Chatbots are computer programs that mimic conversation with people, using artificial intelligence. They are revolutionizing the way we interact with the internet. Let’s take a simple example, to know weather of a place you want to visit for summer vacation, you open weather.com on a browser, then type in the name of the place to get the forecast. With chatbots you will only have to type in a statement “tell me the weather forecast of Paris in the coming weekend”, that’s it, chatbot will reply you with the forecast. </p>

          <p> <p class="mb-0"> <b> Chatbots are not new ! </b></p>The idea to build a conversational agent has been here for more than 50 years, there have been several attempts to build one. For example, Eliza in 1966, the first chatbot, was designed to interact with people as a therapist. Eliza inspired many more like PARRY in 1970s, ALICE in 1990s, SmarterChild in 2000. SmarterChild was integrated with global instant messaging and SMS network, and it used natural language comprehension functionality to respond. </p>

          <p> <p class="mb-0">  <b> Why the hype now ? </b></p>There have been significant advances in AI recently, which is making earlier thought “impossible” tasks into a reality. Riding on these advances, chatbots have sprung back into main stream. In last 5 years, there have been more than 50 startups that are actively working in the chatbot industry. Chatbot market size is predicted to grow to USD 3,172.0 Million by 2021. </p>

          <p> <p class="mb-0"> <b> It’s not only because of AI advancements ! </b></p>We all know when Apple released Iphone i.e. in 2007 and then came Google’s android. This changed the smartphone market drastically and now there are about 5 billion mobile phone users with 2.3 billion having smartphones. This coupled with other technology advancements, like facebook messenger app with 1.2 billion monthly users, gave a good platform for chatbot industry to come up. </p>

          <p> <p class="mb-0"> <b> Chatbots are helping businesses around the world ! </b></p>Industries in all domain are adopting chatbots to help their businesses, like in entertainment industry a London’s agency “Catch” created GoTBoT – a facebook messenger bot which is a digital encyclopedia to help fans of Game of Thrones get answers to all their questions on what has in the show so far. Another exciting field of application is health where as I already stated Melody by Baidu in China is helping doctors diagnose the patients. News industry is also another application area, where CNN has one of the most popular chatbots. HDFC Bank onChat is another example where you can use HDFC services like recharge mobile phones, paying utility bills etc via chat.  </p>

          <p> <p class="mb-0"> <b> Benefits of implementing Chatbot ! </b></p>There are many benefits of implementing chatbots but most important ones are - in customer services, chatbot implementation eliminates the waiting time of customers to get answers for even small queries, this leads to happy and loyal customers. Chatbots can help businesses significantly cut labor costs. Chatbot enables a business – a startup or an established business to reach global audience and connect to them in a very personal manner.  </p>

          <p> <p class="mb-0"> <b> Online tools to build Chatbots ! </b></p>There are many online tools that can help setup chatbot application very quickly, some are proprietary and some are freely available, for example – api.ai, wit.ai these two tools have very similar approach which require very less amount of coding, where as Microsoft bot framework, facebook parlAI (pronounced “par-lay”) require relatively higher amount of coding but they provide more flexibility. There is also motion.ai which provides drag-n-drop interface. One thing common in these online tools are that you must transfer your data to the cloud to use their services and so data privacy and data security must be considered before using them. If online tools are not the option, then one can easily build a custom domain specific chatbot for its business.  </p>

          <p> <p class="mb-0"> <b> Two key components of today’s Chatbot ! </b></p>If we take any AI powered chatbot today, these two components will always be there if you are building your own chatbot or if you are using proprietary chatbot. One is Natural Language Processing; it responsible for understanding the query of the person it is chatting with; it involves extracting the intent and entity and maintaining the context. Second component is responsible for generating responses, this can be a basic lookup in database for responses or it can be more AI driven approach by using intelligent model which generates responses itself.  </p>

          <p> <p class="mb-0"> <b> Is Chatbot of today truly intelligent ? </b></p>This is a question that comes to mind when we use any of the online chatbots available, are they thinking like a human and responding to us? Has AI reached that point where Chatbots are truly independent conversational agent? Answer is No. We are still in its infancy. Chatbots have limitations. AI (Deep learning) showed us how machine could ‘learn’ from test data and can understand natural language but it cannot generate a logical, context specific response on its own. It cannot handle long conversation where it needs to keep track of what has been said, it also cannot handle open domain questions where user can take the conversation anywhere. So, we are far away from a truly intelligent chatbot, but as a community our research is focused in this direction.  </p>

          <p>Chatbot industry is growing at a faster rate than mobile app industry. AI advancements together with other technology advancements like messaging platforms are already providing a way to build a production chatbots that can reach millions of people and help business transform and grow in this digital era.</p>
